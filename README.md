# systemDesign
Here's a curated list of the top 50 system design concepts, organized into foundational, intermediate, and advanced categories. This progression will help you build a solid understanding step by step.

---

## üß± Foundational Concepts

1. **Client-Server Architecture**
   The basic model where clients make requests and servers respond.

2. **IP Addressing & DNS**
   Understanding how devices are identified and how domain names are resolved to IPs.

3. **HTTP/HTTPS Protocols**
   The foundation of web communication, with HTTPS adding encryption.

4. **APIs (REST & GraphQL)**
   Methods for systems to communicate; REST is stateless and resource-based, while GraphQL allows clients to specify data needs.

5. **Databases: SQL vs. NoSQL**
   SQL offers structured data storage with ACID properties; NoSQL provides flexibility and scalability.

6. **CRUD Operations**
   Basic operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

7. **Data Modeling**
   Designing how data is stored and related in databases.

8. **Indexing**
   Improves query performance by creating data structures that allow faster lookups.

9. **Normalization & Denormalization**
   Normalization reduces redundancy; denormalization can improve read performance.

10. **Transactions & ACID Properties**
    Ensures data integrity through Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Intermediate Concepts

11. **Load Balancing**
    Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

12. **Caching**
    Stores frequently accessed data in fast storage to reduce latency.

13. **Message Queues**
    Facilitates asynchronous communication between services, improving scalability and reliability.

14. **Event-Driven Architecture**
    Systems react to events, enabling decoupled and scalable designs.

15. **Microservices Architecture**
    Decomposes applications into small, independent services that communicate over APIs.

16. **Monolithic vs. Microservices**
    Monolithic applications are tightly coupled; microservices offer flexibility and scalability.

17. **API Gateways**
    Acts as a reverse proxy to route requests, aggregate results, and handle cross-cutting concerns.

18. **Service Discovery**
    Automatically detects services in a network, facilitating dynamic routing.

19. **Rate Limiting**
    Controls the rate of requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

20. **Authentication & Authorization**
    Ensures users are who they say they are (authentication) and have permission to perform actions (authorization).

21. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
    Compact, URL-safe tokens used for securely transmitting information between parties.

22. **OAuth 2.0**
    Authorization framework enabling third-party applications to access user data without exposing credentials.

23. **Session Management**
    Maintains stateful information about user interactions across multiple requests.

24. **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)**
    Distributes content to servers closer to users, reducing latency and load times.

25. **Data Replication**
    Copies data across multiple locations to improve availability and fault tolerance.

26. **Data Partitioning (Sharding)**
    Splits large datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces.

27. **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**
    Horizontal scaling adds more machines; vertical scaling adds resources to existing machines.

28. **CAP Theorem**
    In distributed systems, only two of the following can be fully achieved: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.

29. **Eventual Consistency**
    Guarantees that, given enough time, all replicas of data will converge to the same value.

30. **Quorum-Based Replication**
    Ensures data consistency by requiring a majority of nodes to agree on updates.

31. **Data Consistency Models**
    Defines how updates to data are propagated and how consistency is maintained across systems.

32. **Backpressure Handling**
    Mechanisms to prevent systems from being overwhelmed by too much load.

33. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
    Prevents a failure in one part of the system from cascading to other parts.

34. **Retry Logic**
    Attempts to re-execute a failed operation, often with exponential backoff.

35. **Timeouts & Deadlines**
    Specifies the maximum time an operation should take before being aborted.

36. **Bulkheads**
    Isolates failures to prevent them from affecting other parts of the system.

37. **Throttling**
    Controls the amount of data or requests sent to a service to prevent overload.

38. **Data Warehousing**
    Centralizes data from different sources for analysis and reporting.

39. **ETL Processes**
    Extracts, transforms, and loads data into a data warehouse.

40. **Data Lakes**
    Stores large amounts of raw data in its native format until needed.

## üöÄ Advanced Concepts

41. **Service Mesh**
    Manages microservices communication, providing features like load balancing, service discovery, and observability.

42. **Distributed Tracing**
    Tracks requests as they travel through various services, aiding in performance monitoring and debugging.

43. **Chaos Engineering**
    Introduces controlled failures to test system resilience.

44. **Immutable Infrastructure**

* Once deployed, infrastructure components are not modified but replaced with new versions during updates.
* Promotes consistency, reliability, and easier rollbacks.

45. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

* Managing and provisioning infrastructure using code (e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation).
* Enables version control, automation, and repeatability.

46. **Blue-Green & Canary Deployments**

* Deployment strategies to reduce downtime and risk:

  * **Blue-Green:** run two environments; switch traffic to the new one.
  * **Canary:** release to a small group of users before full rollout.

47. **Zero Downtime Deployment**

* Strategies and tools (like load balancers and rolling updates) to deploy without affecting users.

48. **System Observability (Logs, Metrics, Tracing)**

* Ensures insight into a system‚Äôs internal state using:

  * Logs (what happened),
  * Metrics (what is happening),
  * Traces (how it happened).

49. **Rate Control & Traffic Shaping**

* Techniques for managing bandwidth usage and prioritizing traffic to maintain QoS (Quality of Service).

50. **Design for Failure & Redundancy**

* Build systems that assume things will fail (hardware, network, etc.).
* Use techniques like redundancy, replication, failover, and self-healing.
