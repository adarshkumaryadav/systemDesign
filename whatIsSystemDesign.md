Understanding **system design**, including **HLD** (High-Level Design) and **LLD** (Low-Level Design), is critical for software engineers, especially those moving beyond entry-level roles.

## üîß What Is **System Design**?

**System design** is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specific requirements. It bridges the gap between requirements and implementation.

In simple terms:

> It answers **how** a system will be built to meet functional and non-functional needs ‚Äî including performance, scalability, reliability, maintainability, and cost.

## üß± System Design Is Divided Into Two Main Levels:

### 1. üß† **High-Level Design (HLD)**

**Also known as: Architectural Design**

* **Purpose:** Gives a broad view of the system.
* **Audience:** Architects, senior developers, stakeholders.
* **Focus:**

  * Components & modules
  * Services and their interactions
  * Communication protocols (e.g., HTTP, gRPC)
  * Data flow and storage (databases, cache)
  * System boundaries
  * Deployment architecture (cloud, CDN, load balancers)
* **Artifacts:**

  * Component diagrams
  * Architecture diagrams
  * Data flow diagrams
* **Example:** "The system will use a load balancer in front of 3 web servers, which talk to a caching layer and a PostgreSQL database."

### 2. üîç **Low-Level Design (LLD)**

**Also known as: Detailed Design**

* **Purpose:** Describes how each module/component will be implemented.
* **Audience:** Developers implementing the system.
* **Focus:**

  * Class diagrams
  * Method definitions
  * API contracts (endpoints, request/response schemas)
  * DB schema design
  * Detailed data structures and algorithms
* **Artifacts:**

  * Class diagrams (UML)
  * Pseudo code
  * Database schema
* **Example:** "The `UserService` class will have a method `CreateUser()` that validates input, hashes passwords, and stores the record in MongoDB."

## üßë‚Äçüíª Who Is System Design For?

* **Backend Developers:** To design APIs, data flow, and database interactions.
* **Frontend Developers:** To understand system constraints and API contracts.
* **DevOps/Infrastructure Engineers:** To design deployment, monitoring, and scaling strategies.
* **Architects & Tech Leads:** To make long-term decisions on system structure and evolution.
* **Interview Candidates:** Especially for mid-level to senior roles, system design interviews are a key part of the hiring process.

## üí° Why Is System Design Important?

| Benefit                | Description                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**        | Helps the system handle increasing load.              |
| **Performance**        | Ensures fast responses and efficient resource usage.  |
| **Reliability**        | Prevents system crashes and ensures data integrity.   |
| **Maintainability**    | Makes it easier to understand, test, and update code. |
| **Cost-Effectiveness** | Balances performance and infrastructure costs.        |
| **Team Communication** | Provides clear design blueprints for team members.    |

## ‚úÖ How Does System Design Help?

* **Before Development:** It forces you to think through edge cases, bottlenecks, and integrations before you start coding.
* **During Development:** It serves as a blueprint and keeps everyone aligned.
* **During Scaling:** It helps evolve systems without rewriting everything.
* **During Interviews:** Shows your ability to think at scale and design production-ready systems.
